## Critical CSS Tools

The plugin contains tools to manage Critical Path CSS. 

Some of the features:

* Conditional Critical CSS (apply tailored Critical CSS to specific pages based on WordPress conditions and filters)
* Management via text editor and FTP (critical CSS files are stored in the theme directory)
* Full CSS Extraction: selectively export CSS files of a page as a single file or as raw text for use in critical CSS generators.
* Quality Test: test the quality of Critical CSS by comparing it side-by-side with the full CSS display of a page. This tool can be used to detect a flash of unstyled content ([FOUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content)).

Read more about Critical CSS in the [documentation by Google](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/PrioritizeVisibleContent). 
[This article](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical-path-css-tools) by a Google engineer provides information about the available methods for creating critical CSS. 

## CSS Load Optimization

The plugin contains tools to optimize the delivery of CSS in the browser.

Some of the features:

* Async loading via [loadCSS](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS) (enhanced with `requestAnimationFrame` API following the [recommendations by Google](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/OptimizeCSSDelivery))
* Remove CSS files from the HTML source.
* Capture and proxy (script injected) external stylesheets to load the files locally or via a CDN with optimized cache headers. This feature enables to pass the "[Leverage browser caching](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/LeverageBrowserCaching)" rule from Google PageSpeed Insights.

**The plugin does not provide CSS code optimization, minification or concatenation.**

## Javascript Load Optimization

The plugin contains tools to optimize the loading of javascript.

Some of the features:
* Robust async script loader based on [little-loader](https://github.com/walmartlabs/little-loader) by Walmart Labs ([reference](https://formidable.com/blog/2016/01/07/the-only-correct-script-loader-ever-made/))
* HTML5 Web Worker and Fetch API based script loader with localStorage cache and fallback to little-loader for old browsers.
* jQuery Stub that enables async loading of jQuery.
* Abiding of WordPress dependency configuration while loading files asynchronously.
* Lazy Loading Javascript (e.g. Facebook or Twitter widgets) based on [jQuery Lazy Load XT](https://github.com/ressio/lazy-load-xt#widgets).
* Capture and proxy (script injected) external javascript files to load the files locally or via a CDN with optimized cache headers. This feature enables to pass the "[Leverage browser caching](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/LeverageBrowserCaching)" rule from Google PageSpeed Insights.

The HTML5 script loader offers the following advantages when configured correctly:

* 0 javascript file download during navigation
* 0 javascript file download for returning visitors (e.g. from Google search results, leading to a reduced bounce rate)
* faster script loading than browser cache, especially on mobile (according to a [proof of concept](https://addyosmani.com/basket.js/) by a Google engineer)

**The plugin does not provide Javascript code optimization, minification or concatenation.**

### Google PWA Optimization

The plugin contains tools to achieve a 100 / 100 / 100 / 100 score in the [Google Lighthouse Test](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/). Google has been promoting [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) (PWA) as the future of the internet: a combination of the flexability and openness of the existing web with the user experience advantages of native mobile apps. In essence: a mobile app that can be indexed by Google and that can be managed by WordPress. 

This plugin provides an advanced [HTML5 Service Worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers) based solution to create a PWA with any website.

Some of the features:

* JSON based request and cache policy that includes regular expressions and numeric operator comparison for request and response headers.
* Offline availability management: default offline page, image or resource.
* Prefetch/preload resources in the Service Worker for fast access and/or offline availability.
* Event/click based offline cache (e.g. "click to read this page offline")
* HTTP HEAD based cache updates.
* Option to add `offline` class on `<body>` when the connection is offline.
* [Web App Manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/) management: add website to home screen on mobile devices, track app launches and more.

## Google Web Font Optimization

The plugin contains tools to optimize [Google Web Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). 

Some of the features:

* Load Google Web Fonts via [Google Web Font Loader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader).
* Auto-discovery of Google Web Fonts using:
	* Parse `<link rel="stylesheet">` in HTML source.
	* Parse `@import` links in minified CSS from minification plugins (e.g. Autoptimize).
	* Parse existing `WebFontConfig` javascript configuration.
* Remove fonts to enable local font loading.
* Upload Google Web Font Packages from [google-webfonts-helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/) to the theme directory.
